# foot_keys
Buttons you click with your feet. Designed to control the Autoscroll feature on Ultimate Guitar (www.ultimate-guitar.com).

## Overview

I'm learning guitar and trying to play along with the tabs on ultimate-guitar.com. I was constantly stopping my strumming to adjust the scroll rate or pause it. I decided to make a foot operated keyboard so it didn't interrupt my playing.

## Required Materials

  * 3d printer for case.
  * Arduino Micro.
  * Four buttons (12.5mm x 12.55mm).
  * 90&deg; male header.
  * Easily bendable wire.
  * Soldering iron, etc.
  * Hot glue gun for assembly.
