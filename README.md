# foot_keys
Buttons you click with your feet. Designed to control the Autoscroll feature on Ultimate Guitar (www.ultimate-guitar.com).

## Overview

I'm learning guitar and trying to play along with the tabs on ultimate-guitar.com. I was becoming frustrated because I was constantly forced to stop strumming to adjust the scroll speed or pause it. I decided to make a foot operated keyboard so controlling the scroll wouldn't interrupt my playing.

## Required Materials

  * 3d printer for case.
  * Arduino Micro (to deliver key-presses via usb).
  * Micro-usb cord (to connect computer to arduino micro).
  * Four buttons (12.5mm x 12.5mm).
  * 90&deg; male header (or solder onto the board, straight headers are too tall).
  * Easily bendable wire.
  * Shrink-wrap tubes.
  * Soldering iron, etc.
  * Hot glue gun for assembly.
  * Non-skid mat so it doesn't slide around the floor.
